The BUBEN tool automatically generates library abstractions that enable scalable bug detection in large programs with I/O and complex environment.

In order to successfully run all pre-configured experiments, you need to (1) add into the directory benchmarks/specjbb all the necessary proprietary files that make a part of SPECjbb2005 or (2) remove all tasks related to SPECjbb from build.xml.
The necessary files include jbb.jar, dat/SPECjbb_config.props, dat/xml/jbb-document.dtd, and dat/xml/template-document.xml.
